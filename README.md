# Welcome to Bitfest Hackathon 2022

Before you start working, know that we strive for quality. It means you can use any language, tools, third-party
services/API, any architecture to show your skills. We will provide requirements that you have to meet to pass, but you
can code extra features if you want. Keep in mind, don't overdo it for its sake. Prefer high-quality mandatory
requirements over many optional features with lower quality.

We ask you to write a README in Markdown Format and create a presentation of your work to check your communication
skills, but also as a chance for you to reason about your implementation decisions.

> :fire: Do you wish to provide a non-requirement feature or take a different project?
> We can deal with that, as long as you explain the idea.
> And if that's a good idea, you can start implementing it when it is accepted by the judging panel.

We hope everything about the task is clear; if not, we are sorry for that and are more than happy to clarify anything
you did not understand. Let us know, and we will get back to you as soon as we can! We wish you good luck!

## Problem Statement

Resource scarcity has always been a part of our day-to-day life. The Transport sector faces this incident the most for
using the resources in a nonoptimal manner. Local transport usually doesn’t know the demands at any particular time or
route. That’s why we often see many vehicles with vacant seats or pedestrians waiting for them. We aim to build a
platform that solves this problem for a particular segment - University Transport. We are going to develop a strategy
that helps us to allocate the transport at any university in the most optimal way possible. Our target is to satisfy the
demand for transit for the maximum number of consumers.
